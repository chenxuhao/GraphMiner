3-vertex motifs (2 in total): triangle, wedge

4-vertex motifs (6 in total): 3-star, 3-path (3-chain), tailed triangle, 4-cycle (rectangle), diamond, 4-clique

5-vertex motifs (21 in total): 4-star, 4-path (4-chain), tailed 4-clique, tailed 4-cycle, 5-cycle (pentagon), house, hourglass, ... , 5-clique

Refer to Figure 1 in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.09411.pdf) for the motif shapes.
